- happy leap day!!
- Went through all the week 2 scripts from the dropbox and sent formatted messages in the slack to request for all necessary data
Finished commenting on all the 5 scripts and spent the rest of the time looking at possible optimizations for scripts but it's a little difficult because am still waiting on the data : )
