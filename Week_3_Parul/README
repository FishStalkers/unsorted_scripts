- detailed work log here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/16oQrmIECdl2sFpY9hsPkMOaUECYwszmhT_6yGBsGG54/edit
- used Bree's updated directed research script tasks document to reorganize my scripts for this week
- debugged the cvat_analysis.py file (this took a while because of a lot of incompatibilities I worked through
- then began optimizing through importing and using new packages and implementing functions for repeated code
- currently debugging my optimizations (more detail in my google doc), will pass this on to Veena for her hours on Monday
