Veena's Summary:

2/12/24 - Wrote comments on all 5 Week 1 scripts to describe functionality and worked on some optimizations.

2/19/24 - Successfully debugged yolo_annotations_edits.py and combine_51_object.py to make it run without errors.

2/26/24 - Ensured that edits made to yolo_annotations_edits.py to make it run earlier did not change implementation of original code so needed to debug the file further. Optimized code by removing unused code and writing functions for repeated tasks.

3/6/24- Bree added comments to yolo_annotations_edits_optimizations.py please fix
