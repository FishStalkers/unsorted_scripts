Today I worked on running make_dataframe_commented.py and got it to successfully run. I am unsure of the purpose of the first half of the code and made changes to make it run without errors but do not know if it still results in the same intended output because that part of the code is unused for the output. I made an assumption for what the column track_length is on the make_dataframe_commented.py based on cvat_analysis_commented.py because the column is not in the csv file. I am unable to run cvat_analysis_commented.py despite trying many ways to debug. temp_commented.py has the same code segment so I am unable to run both files until I figure out how to resolve this. Also, I am unable to install the imports on shortened_vis.py. Is it a local package because I can't find anything about it online either?
